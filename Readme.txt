This is a game where the object is to hunt other submarines using your sonar which is represented by circle that radiates outward until it hits another sub and then in turn radiates it's echo. The initial ping should not be visible to the player until impact at which point it should indicate original origin of the sonar wave. 

The goal is to add ships as enemies that use depth charges.
